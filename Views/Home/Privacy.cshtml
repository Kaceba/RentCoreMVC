<p>This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use and protect any information about you. It also tells you how to get
    in touch if you have any questions, which we will be more than happy to answer. If you're interested in what we do
    with cookies and similar technologies, please check out our Cookie Statement.

    We may change this Notice from time to time; so please check back here for any updates.

    We offer a range of services related to online car rental, including products and services such as insurance,
    through our own websites, mobile apps, emails and text messages (‘platforms’). We also do this through our business
    partners’ websites, social media and other platforms. This Notice applies to all the personal data we collect while
    we’re doing this, or when you contact us by email, live chat, phone or post. Our business partners should also visit
    our Privacy and Cookie Statement for Business Partners to understand how personal data is processed as part of our
    business relationship.

    We can’t help you make a booking or request a quote without certain information. When you do either of those things,
    we ask you for the information we need so we can give you what you want. This is pretty standard stuff and may
    include your name, age, date and place of birth and contact details (email, address and phone number). It can also
    include information about your passport, identity card and driving licence – and your loyalty programme number and
    payment information.

    In addition, we collect information from your computer when you use one of our platforms, even if you don’t make a
    booking. This may include your IP address, which browser you use, and your language settings. There are also
    situations where we receive information about you from third parties, or automatically collect other information.
    This is a basic overview of the information we collect. Would you like to know more?

    We store and use the information that you give us. When you make a booking, we need at least your name, email
    address and payment information. We might also ask for your home address, phone number and date of birth, and the
    names of any additional drivers.

    If you get in touch with us (by phone, by email or through social media, for example) we will collect information
    from you there too.

    After your booking, we may ask you to provide a review to help us improve our services, and to help ensure future
    customers get exactly what they’re looking for.

    There are also other ways you might give us information. For example, if you’re browsing with your mobile device,
    you can share your current location with us, so we can provide you with the best possible service. To make things
    easier, you can also open a user account, which lets you review and manage your bookings, as well as saving your
    personal settings and your passport and driving licence details. It also makes it easier to make future bookings.

    When you make a booking, we record what platform you made it on, and how you got to our platform (if you came
    through from another site, for example).

    Even if you don’t end up making a booking, we may automatically collect some information when you visit our
    platforms. This may include your IP address, which pages you’ve visited, which browser you’re using, and information
    about clicks. It might also include information about your computer’s operating system, its application version,
    language settings, device-specific setting and characteristics, and data that identifies your device.

    If you’re using a mobile device, we might also collect location details. And we might analyse, and process basic
    data related to the apps installed on it (e.g. name, description and category).
